# Introduction

This is the one of a series of Python packages for
the Zope-based knowledge management platform 
[loops](http://www.wissen-statt-suchen.de).

It will contain functionalities for controlling and 
configuring fields in data entry forms and display views. 

There will be new modules as well as modules migrated from 
the current loops and cybertools repositories.

In order to use this stuff you need [BlueBream](http://bluebream.zope.org/)
and a running loops site. For more information see the 
[loops info site](http://www.wissen-statt-suchen.de/.1944518342).
